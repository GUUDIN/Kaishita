On the mission to develop affordable, small and custumizable vending machines to everyone.

Kashita is a student-lead project born at USP SÃ£o Carlos - Brazil.

Here is a more detailled look into what our goals are:
- Bring automated sales solutions that can fit anywhere
- Crete a purchasing solution as easy as just grabbing the product with your hand (without theft, of course)
- Increase the security of unsupervised sales
- Deliver more payement methods options for the consumers (Pix, credit/debit cards, etc)
- Give feedback to the salesman, with stock management and pricing (AI alert!)

If you want to collaborate, just grab an issue and hop on the project!
